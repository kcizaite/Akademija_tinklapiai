# CSS Positioning

## Instructions

1. Open up the `index.html` file in your browser to see the exercises.
2. Complete each exercise by adding a new ruleset, or multiple rulesets, in order to style the elements according to the instructions.

- Make sure you only edit the `my-styles.css` file. Edits to other files are not allowed.
- Make sure your selectors are specific enough to only target the exercise you're working on.
